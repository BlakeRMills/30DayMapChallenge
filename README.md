# 30DayMapChallenge
Data, Code, and Visualizations for the #30DayMapChallenge


## Day 1 (Points)
For this plot, I wanted to show community spaces in Manhattan. Relatively simple for my first plot. All data comes from NYC Open Data, using the [Borough Boundaries](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Borough-Boundaries/tqmj-j8zm) for the outline of Manhattan and the [Pluto Data](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-pluto-mappluto.page) for the points.

## Day 2 (Lines)
For this map, I tried something a little more ambitious. I wanted to plot the different bike lanes in global cities. All data comes from each cities open data, but I have attached a copy in my repository. I'm thinking about coming back to this plot and adding more cities. Thoughts?
