The tables, which have been installed in ten community parks across the five boroughs, are a way of giving young teens the chance to voice their opinion and reach out to the public in hopes of inspiring social change through their art. LEAP (Learning through an Expanded Art Program), which has provided public arts&ndash;based education to over two million students K-12 throughout New York City, has empowered its students with this project. The program included visits with artists such as Tom Otterness, Christo and Jeanne&ndash;Claude, Dennis Oppenheim, and Kenny Scharf.<\/p><p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;\">Artworks can be found at: Inwood Hill Park and Tompkins Square Park in Manhattan; Commodore Barry Park and Green Central Knoll in Brooklyn; Crotona Park and Claremont Park in Bronx; Juniper Valley Park and Parsons Greenstreet in Queens; and Silver Lake Park and Stapleton Playground in Staten Island.<\/p><p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;\">For more information,&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/sub_things_to_do\/attractions\/public_art\/pdf\/Public_Art_10_Project_Sheet_FINAL_REV_Parks.pdf\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(69, 126, 0);\">download a PDF<\/a>&nbsp;with all of the artwork or visit&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/web\/external\/exit.php&Alpha;url=http%3A\/\/leapnyc.org\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(69, 126, 0);\">the LEAP website.<\/a><\/p><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 11px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); line-height: 15px;\"><\/span>","borough":"c","lat":null,"lng":null,"active":"1"},{"name":"Tree Museum","artist":"Katie Holten","from_date":"2009-06-21","to_date":"2010-02-15","location":"Grand Concourse","description":"&#8203;<span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 11px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); line-height: 15px;\">Celebrating the 2009 centennial of the Grand Concourse in the Bronx, Katie Holten's Tree Museum requires no admission fee.

Each tree is marked off with a vinyl sign indicating its species and a phone number linked to an audio program featuring stories, sounds, and knowledge of each tree and its surrounding site. 100 audio files correspond to the 100 trees and are each recorded by various locals, poets, artists, and musicians from the Bronx community, while other segments record the sounds of trees, animals, insects, and water. In the words of Katie Holten, the museum is intended to &ldquo;give a voice to the inhabitants, the streets, and neighborhoods from the past, present, and future,&rdquo; which are all interconnected.

Woytuk cleverly reduces their shapes to essential forms, allowing the power and elegance of his subjects to become both graceful and whimsical expressions of mass.

However, in our own diverse and pluralistic culture, we tend to value art most highly as the expression of a unique individual vision. <em>Common Ground<\/em> brings together the work of ten international contemporary artists, each with a strikingly original artistic language <em>and<\/em> a strong engagement with its civic context and traditions.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSeveral works in the exhibition create a dialogue with the history of art, finding contemporary metaphors in classical forms. Over time, such forms have lost much of their original authority, yet they continue to resonate for artists today. The civic monument, long dominated by representations of the heroic male, is reinvented through the use of abstraction, irony, and satire. The democratic notion of public space as a forum for ideas is explored through text, objects, and performance. The role of the artist becomes a theme in works that imply both the transience of life and the timelessness of art.

Rather than being a zeitgeist or thematic exhibition, each artist has a distinct artwork (and in some cases performance) that embodies his or her individuality, passion, and exploration of art in the public sphere.

Freedman Plaza","description":"<p>\r\n\tThis 40-foot-tall steel sculpture by Monika Sosnowska marks the threshold between the urban environment of midtown Manhattan and the landscape of Central Park. The artist has used pulleys, cranes, and other heavy machinery to manipulate a spiral staircase to resemble an evergreen tree. No longer climbable, its stairs cascade around the central shaft of the sculpture like weighted tree limbs. The ribbon-like railing forms a twisting red line against the black silhouette of the sculpture. As if piercing the pavement with industrial force, <em>Fir Tree<\/em> (2012) conjures an image of skyscrapers with steel roots below the city.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor more than ten years, Sosnowska&rsquo;s work has explored our psychological relationship to the built environment, creating complex installations that alter our perceptions of familiar objects and spaces. Based in Warsaw, Sosnowska often works with architectural elements associated with Eastern Europe during the Soviet period. <em>Fir Tree<\/em> echoes the industrial steel staircases found on the exterior walls of Polish housing blocks. Here, this once-functional object refuses to serve its intended purpose. Instead it becomes an animated and outsized metaphor, testing the bounds of a familiar form as it reaches toward the urban skyline.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis Exhibition is presented by the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.publicartfund.org\/\">Public Art Fund<\/a>.<\/p>","borough":"M","lat":"40.76508","lng":"-73.97291","active":"1"},{"name":"Abraham Lincoln: War Veteran Projection","artist":"Krzysztof Wodiczko","from_date":"2012-11-08","to_date":"2012-12-09","location":"South of Pavilion","description":"<p>The voices and images of recent veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, as well as Vietnam veterans, animate the historic bronze commemorative statue of Abraham Lincoln that has stood silently in Union Square since 1870.

Freedman Plaza","description":"<p>Towering in cast bronze, it is astonishing that Thomas Sch&uuml;tte&rsquo;s <i>United Enemies<\/i> has its origins in a series of small figures the artist made with modeling clay in the early 1990s. Sch&uuml;tte (b. 1954, Oldenburg, Germany) conceived the series during a residency in Italy at a time when several politicians had been arrested for corruption. These figures, however, are mythical characters rather than specific individuals. Their paired forms are highly abstracted, with heads emerging from swaddling robes that conceal their limbs. Faces are aged and anguished, rendered in soft focus to suggest the waning power of would-be patriarchs. In contrast, the tightly knotted rope that binds them is sharply detailed, drawing the figures &ndash; and our eyes &ndash; into focus.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Monumental bronze statuary is among the most traditional forms of public art. The artist&rsquo;s choice of Central Park for the display of this work places it in dialogue with that tradition. With typical inventiveness, Sch&uuml;tte has taken a conventional form and made it relevant. His colossal figures do not stand heroically atop a classical pedestal but seem to stagger, earthbound, on tripods of bundled poles. Struggling to be rid of its mate, each figure is nevertheless incapable of standing alone. They have become potent contemporary metaphors: sculpted giants that simultaneously resonate with the mythological, the political, and the personal.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This exhibition is presented by the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.publicartfund.org\/\">Public Art Fund<\/a>. <\/p>","borough":"M","lat":"40.76515","lng":"-73.97279","active":"1"},{"name":"Organic Abstracts","artist":"Dianne Smith","from_date":"2013-03-07","to_date":"2013-04-15","location":"Bartow Pell Mansion","description":"<p>The West Harlem Art Fund and Bartow Pell present two works by artist Dianne Smith on the grounds of this historic house. <i>The Couple<\/i> is two androgynous heads approximately twenty feet wide and ten feet tall.

At first glance it looks like a  massive cube made from large stone blocks &ndash; but with a number of blocks missing  at the corners. On closer examination it becomes evident that the work hasn&rsquo;t  been constructed out of individual elements but rather cast in stone-like  concrete as a unified form. We see that the &ldquo;mortar&rdquo; is exactly the same as the  &ldquo;block&rdquo; itself and that the entire sculpture is consistent in color, texture,  and finish. The &ldquo;missing&rdquo; corner elements were never there but are instead  deliberately composed openings that allow transparency and access to the  interior space. <\/p>\r\n  <p>Do Esp&iacute;rito Santo speaks of the work as a kind of &ldquo;idealized ruin&rdquo; that is also  a metaphorical playground. As a child the artist loved to play with building  blocks. Given its architectural materials and oversized scale, <em>Playground<\/em> is a bit like a blown up cartoon image of a child&rsquo;s fantasy building. At the same  time, the artist has created a subtle and elegant play between perception and  reality, construction and destruction, and between idealized form and everyday  objects and materials. <\/p>\r\n\r\n  <p>This exhibition is presented by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.publicartfund.org\/\">Public  Art Fund<\/a>. <\/p>","borough":"M","lat":"40.766","lng":"-73.9732","active":"1"},{"name":"Geolocation: DUMBO","artist":"Nate Larson and Marni Shindelman","from_date":"2013-09-18","to_date":"2014-09-17","location":"Washington Street and Prospect Street","description":"<p><em>Geolocation: DUMBO<\/em> is a new Twitter-inspired public  art piece from photographers and self-described &ldquo;virtual fl&acirc;neurs&rdquo; Nate  Larson and Marni Shindelman.

Each see-through globe lit from within will house used batteries,  tossed-out computer parts, castoff electronic transistor parts, vacuum tubes,  shredded rubber tires and recycled plastic flotsam.

She came to see the miles of pedestrian paths  that traverse its landscape as similar to the arteries of a living being.  There&rsquo;s no singular way to walk through the park, but rather a multitude of  possible routes that may be followed according to our own desires.<\/p>\r\n<p>Drawing on  existing maps, Trouv&#233; isolated all of the marked pathways in the park and  estimated their distances. She identified 212, from secluded paths to prominent  thoroughfares, ranging in length from around 60 feet to four miles. Translating  her research into three-dimensional form, Trouv&#233; created three large-scale  storage racks that house a total of 212 spools. Each spool is wound with rope  equivalent in length to a corresponding pathway and labeled to identify its  location in the park.<\/p>\r\n<p>Trouv&#233;&rsquo;s  work is also a reflection on the broader cultural significance of walking. It&rsquo;s  an activity that ranges from personal recreation to political statement, and  has inspired poets, musicians, writers, and artists. Thus, Trouv&#233; has  associated each pathway with a title drawn from culture and history that  relates to walking. In this way, <em>Desire  Lines<\/em> is both a systematic inventory of the park and an invitation to  explore the political and poetic resonance of the simple act of taking a walk.<\/p>\r\n<p>This  exhibition is presented by the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.publicartfund.org\/\">Public  Art Fund<\/a>. <\/p>","borough":"M","lat":"40.7654","lng":"-73.97275","active":"1"},{"name":"Toro","artist":"Allen Glatter","from_date":"2015-04-17","to_date":"2016-03-20","location":null,"description":"<p>&ldquo;At first  sight, the sculpture of Allen Glatter might appear to be a literal take on Paul  Klee&rsquo;s remark that a drawing is simply a line going on a walk.

Constructed from  seamlessly joined steel tubing, uniform in diameter, the freestanding  sculptures simultaneously gather and perforate the spaces around them. Walking  around the work produces a pleasant feeling that seems to derive from a rhythm  of anticipation and surprise; despite the few formal elements involved, the  overall experience varies radically from one vantage point to another.

Throughout his career, Johnson has explored  the ways in which we form our sense of belonging to races and communities,  investigating the relationship between familiar objects and identity.<\/p>\r\n<p>For his High Line Commission, Johnson built one of his minimalist  three-dimensional steel black grids, which houses a variety of objects  including busts painted to resemble shea butter (a material commonly used by  the artist), and acts as a living greenhouse as plants on the High Line begin  to intertwine with the sculpture over the year of its installation.

He  sculpted peacocks, seagulls; swans, dolphins. The animals he chose to represent  were generally peaceful animals.

In 2014 she took part in the Engaging Artists Residency  organized by the <a href=\"http:\/\/avcenter.org\/engaging-artists\/\">Artist Volunteer Center<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/moreart.org\/\">More Art<\/a>, which primarily focused on homelessness. <em>Engaging Artists<\/em><em>&nbsp;<\/em>encourages local artists to deepen  their understanding of socially engaged art through volunteer opportunities and  interactive workshops with professionals in the fields of fine art and  activism. During this six&ndash;week program, participants were required to volunteer  at least a half a day per week at a local charitable organization.<\/p>\r\n<p>  In 2013, Alli&eacute; also exhibited the public artwork <em>Serendipity <\/em>in Tompkins Square Park. The sculpture was a life&ndash;size,  steel silhouette of a formerly homeless man who spent much of his time in the  park. Furthermore, <em>A Bench for the Night<\/em> is the continuation of her earlier neon sculpture <em>The Glowing Homeless<\/em> created in 2011 for <em>Bring to Light: Nuit Blanche New York <\/em>in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. <em>The Glowing Homeless<\/em> was a neon outline  of a human form that rested on a park bench. By rendering the homeless person  in neon light asleep amongst the park&rsquo;s crowds she created an alluring object  using an attractive material that reversed the normal reaction of avoidance and  instead drew people towards the form on the bench. Alli&eacute;&rsquo;s new A <em>Bench For the Night<\/em> will invite the  audience to sit on the bench, an interaction between the public and the artwork  that was not possible with <em>The Glowing  Homeless<\/em>.<\/p>\r\n<p>  While A <em>Bench For a Night <\/em>primarily  alludes to homelessness, the piece also reflects one&rsquo;s desire to seek an  isolated place to rest and remove oneself from the continuous movement of the  city. When preparing for this exhibit, Alli&eacute; noticed a lack of seating in the  immediate vicinity. By placing the bench&ndash;sculpture in this small plaza, she has  created a new social space that simultaneously raises awareness on homelessness  among the general public, as well as artists and art&ndash;lovers visiting MoMA PS1 located  across the street. <\/p>","borough":"Q","lat":"40.745575","lng":"-73.946588","active":"1"},{"name":"Please Touch the Art","artist":"Jeppe Hein","from_date":"2015-05-17","to_date":"2016-03-20","location":null,"description":"<p>Three bodies of work are represented in the exhibition by Danish artist Jeppe Hein.

The bell is silent now, as the tower  was temporarily dismantled in 2015 as the first phase for its reconstruction.  Simultaneously, Harlem is undergoing dynamic change and New York City is  experiencing a resurgence of public culture. caesura seeks to temporarily fill  an architectural gap &ndash; and create a social space &ndash; by echoing and inverting the  form and function of the absent tower. Like the bell, caesura aims to call up  the neighborhood, to preserve and revitalize Harlem&rsquo;s histories, and to connect  newer and older community members to each other, by reactivating this site for  congregation, viewing, and listening. The installation will reframe history  with a temporary structure and sound. A &ldquo;caesura&rdquo; is a break or pause, a place  to catch your breath, most specifically in ancient spoken-word art. <\/p>\r\n<p>The architectural component of this piece begins at the Acropolis  ground as an open-air, steel frame that supports a &ldquo;horizontal tower&rdquo;, which  the viewer can pass through and meander under. In the center of the piece, a  flattened &ldquo;bell&rdquo; made of reflective steel. <\/p>\r\n<p>The sonic component of the piece consists of Feldman&rsquo;s interactive  composition, made up of bell sounds and voices. Historical and contemporary  recordings and live-streaming voices from speeches, rallies, chants, and  assemblies in Harlem are alternated with a through-composed layer of echoing  bells. Analogous to a megaphone, the formal profile of the tower has been  tipped sideways, allowing sound to be projected outward. Taut, translucent film  runs through this shape and is mounted with electromagnetic transducers that  turn the material into a speaker, allowing sound to pour down from the spaces  in between the arches above visitors. A microphone mounted at the entrance to  the installation allows visitors to broadcast their own voices through the  piece. Those not present can participate through an interactive online  component, allowing them to trigger the bell and contribute their own live  audio to the arches.

Since  ancient times, however, we have invented ways of measuring time in smaller  units with ever&ndash;increasing precision &mdash; from the sundial to the hourglass to the  atomic clock. As clock making technology advanced during the Renaissance,  handsome public clocks became a source of civic pride, as well as a useful  amenity. In today&rsquo;s digital age, they more often evoke a sense of nostalgia for  another era.<\/p>\r\n<p> In <em>Against the Run<\/em>, Alicja Kwade (b. 1979, Katowice, Poland) has created  a clock that tells the correct time, but does so in a way that confounds expectations.  Adapting a nineteenth&ndash;century design that we might typically see in New York  City, the artist has reversed the conventional mechanism.

A meeting point in the processing time from past and to the future. We might call it the &ldquo;moment;&rdquo; it is short and creative. It entails catching an idea when it appears like a flash of light. It can &mdash; and must &mdash; disappear in the next femtosecond. A &ldquo;moment&rdquo; can mean a minute portion of time, or the product of quantity (as a force) and the distance to a particular point. THE MOMENT in contemporary art can be ideally a philosophical term and scientific necessity.<\/p>\r\n<p>In 2015, the Taiwanese American Arts Council takes THE MOMENT as a theme, and develops it to a series of multi&ndash;disciplinary programs taking place in various venues. The traditional format of painting shares space with the latest interactive technology. These are threads expressing multiple directions, meeting in this MOMENT. The MOMENT investigates the play of the virtual and the real, inward and outward, our intimate reflection on a surface, dark and light, or a view of self in the outside environment. The Moment visualizes a picture, an object, a location, a person, or a fanciful collective memory of how we evolved as creatures. We are about to investigates the artist&rsquo;s relation to society and himself.<\/p>\r\n<p>Artists on view in Flushing Meadows Corona Park as part of THE MOMENT include Ya-Hon Chang, Tang-Wei Hsu, Kuang-Yu Lee, Wen-Fu Yu. <\/p>\r\n<p>This exhibition is presented by the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mocataipei.org.tw\/\">Museum of Contemporary Art, Taipei<\/a> and the <a href=\"http:\/\/themoment.taac.gallery\/\">Taiwanese American Arts Council<\/a><\/p>","borough":"Q","lat":"40.746612","lng":"-73.845092","active":"1"},{"name":"My Circle","artist":"Beverly Pepper","from_date":"2015-10-23","to_date":"2016-05-31","location":null,"description":"<p>In special recognition of Beverly Pepper&rsquo;s 93rd birthday, the  monumental sculpture <em>My Circle, 2008<\/em> is on view in Union Square. The sculpture continues the artist&rsquo;s contemplation  of time, materiality and place, and is part of <em>Curvae<\/em>, her series of curved forms. By using Cor&ndash;Ten steel, a  corrosion&ndash;resistant material that naturally and quickly develops a  weathered&ndash;looking patina, Pepper is able to speed up the oxidation process, and  in so doing suggest the concept of elapsed time through the sculpture&rsquo;s skin of  rust.<\/p>\r\n<p>Like many of her monumental works, <em>My  Circle<\/em> engages the viewer through the interplay of convex and concave  forms. The use of opposing forces &ndash; vertical and horizontal, interior and  exterior &ndash; creates a lyrical meditation of space that is at once dominant and  intimate. The artist has stated that &ldquo;Seeing, touching, and the physical  sensory engagement is the way into my sculpture; my intention is that the  meaning of my work rests in experiencing it, similar to the performing arts  where listening and seeing the moments of a performance where meaning is  revealed through experience.&rdquo; She notes that <em>My Circle<\/em>, standing at fourteen feet tall in Cor&ndash;Ten steel, for her  recalls an image from years ago relating to the symbolic character in Zen  Buddhism where it is known as the Enso, a drawing in ink of an open or closed  circle. The closed circle represents the totality of experience and life. The  open circle represents the imperfection found in all things, and is known as  the circle of enlightenment, its symbolism referring to the beginning and end  of all things, the circle of life, and the connectedness of existence.

But, as Riley states, &ldquo;the tradition of the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day Parade is  entirely American.&rdquo; The first parade in honor of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day was  organized by Irishmen serving in the British army stationed in Boston,  Massachusetts in 1737. It began as nothing more than drunken revelry, singing,  and a shared sense of homesickness. 200 years later the tradition was adopted  in Ireland and today there are St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day parades in 15 nations across  six continents.<\/p>\r\n<p>  During a 2007 visit to Havana, Riley discovered that his  Irish roots had Cuban connections. In fact, one of of the city&rsquo;s main streets  is called Calle O&rsquo;Reilly, named for Alejandro O&rsquo;Reilly, an Irishman and early  abolitionist who served as a general in the Spanish army in 18th&ndash;century Cuba  and later served as governor of Spanish&ndash;occupied Louisiana. Like O&rsquo;Reilly, many  Irish settled in Cuba in the 18th and 19th centuries, leaving a legacy of  prominent historical figures of Irish&ndash;Cuban descent and there are still a great  number of current day Cuban residents with Irish heritage.<\/p>\r\n<p>  With this history in mind, Duke Riley returned to Cuba in  2009 to stage the first St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day Parade in Havana, a performance for  &lsquo;Chelsea Visits Havana&rsquo; at Museum Nacional de Bellas Artes as part of the  Havana Biennial. The Broadway Billboard on view at Socrates Sculpture Park  consists of a section of a larger drawing the artist did as a record of his  2009 performance, along with representations of iconic American cartoon  characters marching through the streets of Havana.<\/p>\r\n<p>  Like the first parades in America, Riley&rsquo;s St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day  performance reminded participants of the positive potentials of social  inclusion and cultural exchange from the earliest parades and commemorations.  Riley&rsquo;s 2009 parade displayed a romanticized vision of a distant land &ndash;  Ireland, Cuba, and America &ndash; separated by the sea. With today&rsquo;s warming of  relations between historically cool American and Cuban governments, El Primero  Desfile de San Patricio en la Habana, Cuba presciently experiments with the  merging of the two cultures.<\/p>\r\n<p>This exhibition is presented by <a href=\"http:\/\/socratessculpturepark.org\/exhibition\/broadway&ndash;billboard&ndash;duke&ndash;riley\/\">Socrates  Sculpture Park<\/a><\/p>","borough":"Q","lat":"40.76844","lng":"-73.936467","active":"1"},{"name":"OY\/YO","artist":"Deborah Kass","from_date":"2015-11-11","to_date":"2016-08-31","location":null,"description":"<p>Walking the line between respectful homage and brazen appropriation, Brooklyn-based artist Deborah Kass mimics and reworks the signature styles of iconic 20th century male artists &mdash;including Frank Stella, Andy Warhol, Jackson Pollock, Ed Ruscha, and Robert Indiana &ndash; often with a feminist twist. OY\/YO is sourced from urban and Brooklyn slang, the statement &ldquo;I am&rdquo; in Spanish, and the popular Yiddish expression, as a riff on Ruscha&rsquo;s iconic word paintings. <\/p>\r\n<p>OY\/YO has been a significant and reoccurring motif in Kass&rsquo; work since its first appearance in 2011, taking form in paintings, prints, and tabletop sculptures. Set alongside the iconic bridges of Brooklyn&rsquo;s waterfront and visible to viewers from Manhattan, Brooklyn Bridge Park&rsquo;s Main Street lawn is an apt location for a monumental installation of OY\/YO. Similar to the City of New York&rsquo;s &ldquo;Leaving Brooklyn: Oy Vey!&rdquo; sign at the Williamsburg Bridge and the &ldquo;Leaving Brooklyn: Fuhgeddaboudit&rdquo; sign on the BQE, OY\/YO references Brooklyn&rsquo;s ethnic communities with whimsy and warmth. <\/p>\r\n<p>Commissioned by Two Trees and presented in partnership with Brooklyn Bridge Park, the work will be on view through August 2016 and is presented on the occasion of the artist&rsquo;s exhibition No Kidding opening at Paul Kasmin Gallery in Chelsea December 9, 2015.

The Park Avenue presentation adds a third dimension: the works shift in their composition according to the sightlines of the viewer. The repetition of the sculpture&mdash;which depicts the back of a figure such as an anonymous pedestrian would be seen from behind whilst walking the street&mdash;is akin to optical illusion, compelling viewers to double-take.<\/p><p>This exhibition is presented by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/fundforparkavenue.org\/\">Fund for Park Avenue&nbsp;<\/a>and&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.kasmingallery.com\/\">Paul Kasmin Gallery<\/a><u>.<\/u>&nbsp;<\/p>","borough":"M","lat":"40.762283","lng":"-73.970274","active":"1"},{"name":"Under the Sun","artist":"Bill Soltis","from_date":"2019-08-27","to_date":"2020-07-31","location":"Greenstreet on Flatbush Avenue between 7th Avenue and Park Place","description":"<p>Under the Sun is one of a series of sculptures by Brooklyn-based artist Bill Soltis about experimentation with the human form, positive and negative relationships and the interplay between the figure and a sculptural environment. The final piece is a marriage of these elements and the environment in which the sculpture rests. In his art, Soltis experiments with shapes, images, patterns, and lines, allowing the construction process to create the idea, rather than forcing a completely formed idea into becoming an object. As a subject, the human figure lends itself well to this open process. It can be left representational or made abstract. Its form can be smooth, angular, sharp, or curved, with active, passive, or emotive gestures. He often works with welded metal due to its versatility, permanence, and strength and ability to survive indoor, outdoors, in gardens, or urban settings equally well.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This exhibition is presented in partnership with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/northflatbushbk\/\">North Flatbush Business Improvement District<\/a>.<\/p>","borough":"B","lat":"40.677376","lng":"-73.972489","active":"1"},{"name":"The Horses","artist":"Jean-Marie Appriou","from_date":"2019-09-11","to_date":"2020-08-30","location":"Doris C.

Approaches vary among collaborative investigations of authorship and visibility, the re-contextualization of domestic motifs, and the examination of biological material, among many others. Ranging from fantastical to anecdotal to pedagogical, this year&rsquo;s artists use a variety of narrative strategies. Several artist projects examine storytelling&rsquo;s many material manifestations, from an homage to a Native American myth in which North America exists on a turtle&rsquo;s back to a suggestion that a giant has fallen asleep under the Park&rsquo;s blanket of grass, its exposed nose becoming refuge for a wandering monitor lizard.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Participating artists are recipients of &lsquo;The 2019 Socrates Annual Fellowship&rsquo; and were selected by Socrates&rsquo; Curator &amp; Director of Exhibitions, Jess Wilcox, and the Park&rsquo;s 2019 Curatorial Advisors &ndash; Rosario G&uuml;iraldes, Assistant Curator at The Drawing Center and Jennie Lamensdorf, Bay Area Lead at Facebook&rsquo;s Art Department.The 2019 Socrates Annual artists are&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/socratessculpturepark.org\/artist\/jesus-benavente\/\">Jesus Benavente<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/socratessculpturepark.org\/artist\/tecumseh-ceaser\/\">Tecumseh Ceaser (NativeTec)<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/socratessculpturepark.org\/artist\/onyemaechi-crouch-anyarogbu\/\">Martina Onyemeachi Crouch-Anyarogbu (MOCA)<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/socratessculpturepark.org\/artist\/rachelle-dang\/\">Rachelle Dang<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/socratessculpturepark.org\/artist\/chris-domenick\/\">Chris Domenick<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/socratessculpturepark.org\/artist\/hadi-fallahpisheh\/\">Hadi Fallahpisheh<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/socratessculpturepark.org\/artist\/jes-fan\/\">Jes Fan<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/socratessculpturepark.org\/artist\/hadrien-gerenton-loup-sarion\/\">Hadrien G&eacute;renton &amp; Loup Sarion<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/socratessculpturepark.org\/artist\/paul-kopkau\/\">Paul Kopkau<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/socratessculpturepark.org\/artist\/alva-mooses\/\">Alva Mooses<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/socratessculpturepark.org\/artist\/marius-ritiu\/\">Marius Ritiu<\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/socratessculpturepark.org\/artist\/martin-roth\/\">&nbsp;Martin Roth<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/socratessculpturepark.org\/artist\/gabriela-salazar\/\">Gabriela Salazar<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/socratessculpturepark.org\/artist\/lucia-thome\/\">Lucia Thom&eacute;<\/a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/socratessculpturepark.org\/artist\/workers-art-coalition\/\">Workers Art Coalition (WAC)<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This exhibition is presented by&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/socratessculpturepark.org\/exhibition\/the-socrates-annual-2018\/\">Socrates Sculpture Park<\/a>.<\/p>","borough":"Q","lat":"40.768465","lng":"-73.936652","active":"1"},{"name":"The Immigrant Journey -- Past Meets Present (Mural)","artist":"Lina Montoya","from_date":"2019-10-08","to_date":"2020-10-07","location":null,"description":"<p>This mural, depicting waves, mountains and stars, is a companion artwork to the &nbsp;expansive fence installation above it.

The public artwork will be geolocated at a series of sites and experienced on smartphones and tablets through Baker Cahill&rsquo;s free 4th Wall app. This project, which is two years in the making, lives at the vibrant intersection of public art, social consciousness, and tech. It is being presented simultaneously in six cities in the United States: Boston, MA, Charleston, SC, Philadelphia, PA, Rockaway, NY, Selma, AL, and Washington, DC.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this polarized and tumultuous election year, many concerns persist around the founding principles of American freedom and democracy. Inequality, structural racism, injustice, and the ability to vote are chief among them. Inspired by the original cracked Liberty Bell in Philadelphia, the drawing hovers beyond viewers, swaying with the rich and layered sound of bells tolling. The Liberty Bell soundscape morphs from the rhythmic lulling of a tolling bell, into a harmonious and dissonant sequence of ringing as it becomes increasingly unpredictable and arrhythmic. The richly textured brushstrokes and bell sounds resemble loosely knitted threads that unravel and come together in an uncomfortable, but cohesive moment. They reflect the evolution and transformation of liberty over time into the complex reality we face today.

Applicants to the 2021 open call were asked to submit proposals that addressed the many meanings of sanctuary &ndash; as spaces of rest and protection; as sacred sites; and as supportive environments. Most crucially, artists were asked: how can art function as a sanctuary, a place of refuge, rest and meditation &ndash; without resorting to escapism?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The eleven projects selected represent a range of interpretations, drawing from diverse communities, traditions, and artistic strategies to create unique sculptures and installations. Several threads emerge throughout the exhibition, including practices of self-care, the spiritual elements of natural phenomena, and meditations on the conditions that necessitate sanctuary. Some projects provide space for mourning modes of oppression and acknowledge that sanctuaries are not always spaces free from fear.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>For many of the artists, sanctuary is not necessarily a fixed geographical location, but a time-bound space that is created and recreated against the backdrop of threats such as illness, climate change, the collapse of the social service systems, and violence of racism and colonialism.
